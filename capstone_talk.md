# [Capstone_2026_updates_to_a_changing_market](https://youtu.be/FpJRYojmHiQ)

- cloud network & Ai have high ROI on the job hunt
- Software engineering is odd in that you can generate experience without a licence or a job.
- Last cohort all patched a bug in Firefox. (This was and will be an optional part of the job hunt portion)
- AI engineering is a huge ROI investment activity.
- Job hunt and extra work is getting longer, but the coursework is still 16 weeks.
- AI is like a Database, just with 'embeddings'
  - a DB is deterministic, so it will always give you back what you want, AI is just that but less deteministic.
  - AI is just another component when we're building a new component.
- When people started using facebook their expectations grew a huge amount.
  - standard expectation for feature exploded -> this anecdote is just because as users get used to working with AI, there is going to be a standard expectation for an AI part of your app.
  ### OSI
- OSI program for transitioning to work (OSI?)
  - 4 weeks of dedicated time
  - mandate pairing & full-time
- Internships
- Work and education -> OSI is in the middle. Not work, but not purely education.
- Optional.
- It's offered by LS
- Not just US students
  - Some internships can only do US, but most are just looking for good people.

### Job hunt
- job hunt ability is important -> a big difference -> soft skills
- Almost no one is coming out of capstone saying "I am an AI engineer", but it's going to help a lot in the job hunt.
- The job hunt is (on paper) full time. Otherwise "It's a slippery slope", but they're generally reasonable about mitigating circumstances.
#### long job-hunt
- some people push the 12 month job hunt. Some people lose steam or take time off.
- Most people who can sustain a long job hunt -> they land. If you sustain it, you can find a place.
- If you don't find a job after 12 months, you're still talking to LS and mentors, LS will wait for the payment.
- Job hunt is the main work of Capstone.
- Chris Lee has so many resources to help.
- There is an Alumni slack channel. Recently everyone's hiring.
- Pro-tip for anyone in Capstone -> a huge part of it is staying in touch. Stay in constant communication. It's hard, a lot of people don't really do this.
###
- part-time doesn't really work. Job-hunt or Capstone. Part-time would be a year and a half long program with a 5% comlpletion rate.
- What makes LS qualified to teach AI stuff?
  - No one's qualified right now. We're on the frontier.
  - Making LS bot has generated the same problems that are being taught about in AI courses now.
  - It's less teaching and more collaborating. Students are treated as peers, as software-engineers.
### What is AI engineering?
- Yes it is calling an API, but there's a lot to it.
- on the machine-learnign side, it's the people creating LLMs, that's not us, although some details bleed through.
- Beyond that there's prompting and there's determination
- Up to now there are no best practices
- At a high level there's a ton of work about calling the API.
### Is an internship spot guaranteed?
- no.
- but OSI yes.
- So far anyone who wants to do it can. The trend has been there are more spots than internships.
### Soft skills
- working remote is tough
  - you have to be proactive
  - you have to find the work
- if you want to do well work on these soft-skills. It's not about the technical side.
- Study with other people is really necessary.
### The market
- The market is always ending, every couple of years.
- There is erosion of the industry, at the low end, but the high-end remians in order to build these tools that are eroding the industry.
- The industry is always about disrupting the industry. We have always been in the business of disrupting the labour market.
- Your margin's my opportunity.
- The way to participlate in this unstable environment is to be highly compentent.
- 90% of Chris' job regarding capstone is soothing people's nerves
- Ginne Pinckert is working as an AI engineer now.
