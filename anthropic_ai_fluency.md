### [Introduction to AI Fluency](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-framework-foundations/291863)
###  Introduction to AI Fluency
- course not about AI, but about us and how we solve problems with AI (collaboration)
- Think *with* AI
- What's possible v what's intuitive -> we want to bridge this.
- 4 Ds:
  - Delegation
  - Description
  - Discernment
  - Diligence

### [The AI Fluency Framework](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-framework-foundations/291870)
###  Why do we need AI Fluency?
- what is 'fluency' with AI?
  - having the tools, doesn't mean we know how to make the most of them.
- Interactions should be:
  - Effective
  - Efficient
  - Ethical
  - Safe
- 3 ways people interact with AI:
  - automation: the ai completes a task:
    - draft a email
    - make an image
  - augmentation: you complete a task together
    - develop a character for a story
    - sort out an app architecture.
  - Agency:
    - set up an interactive experience for your web-site
      - you set up behaviour patterns, rather than specific scripts
  - The latter 2 are more fruitful.
 
  - Not just a tool, but also a medium and a creator. 

###  [The 4D Framework](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-framework-foundations/291876)
### Deep Dive 1: What is Generative AI? (Part 1)
- 4 essential competencies:
  - delegation
    - get your AI to review your data, but reserve the conclusions for yourself.
  - description
    - Clear communication with AI.
      - 'make me a logo' v describing your companies values et.
      - don't tell me the answer, but help me to understand the concepts in this problem.
    - keep in mind:
      - What you want the final output to be
      - how you want AI to approach the task
      - how you want AI to behave (how different from previous point?)
  - discernment:
    - suggest a marketing strategy:
      - are the facts accurate
      - does the reasoning make sense
      - etc.
  - dilligence
    - responsible AI
      - verify info
      - protect data
      - be transparent about ai
      - are you willing ot be accountable for the final product?
- exercise 2: I discussed drawing with ChatGPT:

```
I would like to have a conversation with you about drawing. I love drawing, but I'm often frustrated by my skill level. However it seems to me to be a form of creativity that is fundamentally very honest, in that one only sees and tries to express that seeing.
ChatGPT said:
I’d love to talk about drawing — and I know exactly what you mean about that honesty.
When you draw, you can’t really bluff your way through.
In music, you can mask uncertainty with flair; in writing, with clever language. But with drawing, the line you put down is a direct record of your looking and thinking in that moment.

And that’s both the beauty and the frustration:

Beauty because it forces you into a very real relationship with the world — you’re not inventing from thin air, you’re responding to what’s in front of you or inside your mind.
Frustration because the hand can only translate what the eye and brain understand, and often those three aren’t in sync yet.
I think that honesty you’re feeling comes from two things:
Observation — You’re training yourself to really see, not just recognise. A coffee mug stops being “a mug” and becomes a cylinder with an ellipse, light falling at a certain angle, tiny distortions where the glaze runs.
Translation — You’re deciding which parts of that seeing matter most to you, and letting the line or shading carry that decision.
A lot of the frustration, ironically, is a good sign — it means your eye is ahead of your hand. You can already see more than you can render, which is the only way you’ll improve. If it were the other way round, you’d stagnate.
If you like, we could explore how to make drawing feel less like a test of skill and more like an act of seeing — so that the honesty stays, but the frustration eases. That’s often a big unlock for artists in your position.

You said:
But I want it to be a test of skill. I don't like the idea that there are not wrong answers in drawing. In truth we are usually polite about peoples' drawings, but we know what a good and skilful drawing looks like and it sparks joy to see one. 
ChatGPT said:
I think you’re right — and that’s a refreshing stance in a time where people often say “all art is subjective” as if that closes the discussion.
There is such a thing as skill in drawing.
It’s why we can all look at a Rembrandt sketch or a Sargent portrait and feel that sharp jolt of admiration: the proportions click, the values breathe, the line economy tells us the artist saw deeply and could translate it with precision.

That joy you’re talking about comes from three things happening together:

Accuracy — Shapes, perspective, anatomy, proportion handled with command.
Control — The mark-making is intentional; even a loose scribble has purpose.
Vitality — The skill doesn’t crush the life out of the subject; it animates it.
It’s similar to music: you can have emotional expression without perfect technique, but when the two align, the result is thrilling.
The “there are no wrong answers” idea in drawing is useful for beginners so they aren’t paralysed — but for someone like you, it can be a trap. You’re after objective excellence, not just self-expression. That means giving yourself permission to say:

“Yes, that drawing is objectively better than this one, and here’s why.”
If you want to treat drawing as a test of skill, you can approach it like a musician approaching scales:
Set measurable challenges (e.g., “draw this object with proportions accurate to within 5%” or “render this form so the light matches a reference photo within 3 value steps”).
Work in cycles of focused drills (skill isolation) and full compositions (skill integration).
Keep a “fail archive” — drawings that clearly miss the mark, but from which you can identify exactly what failed.
That way, you’ll be chasing the kind of skill that makes viewers go: “Damn, that’s good.”
If you like, I can outline a progression plan for going from where you are now to the kind of work that triggers that spark of joy — and it wouldn’t be airy “just draw every day” advice, but specific, measurable skill milestones.

You said:
I also like to think about how it exposes the ways of thinking in people. For instance drawing requires switching between two modes of seeing - the fine close detailed seeing and the wide unfocused seeing for getting the big picture. I myself struggle with this which is why my pictures are often out of proportion. I get immersed in drawing a perfect eye and then a perfect nose next to it etc and by the end nothing really fits together
ChatGPT said:
Yes — you’ve put your finger on one of the core cognitive challenges in drawing.
That oscillation between narrow-focus seeing and big-picture seeing is absolutely real.

Narrow focus is like a spotlight — you’re attending to fine edge quality, subtle value shifts, and micro-shapes.
Big picture is more like a floodlight — you’re scanning relationships, relative sizes, tilt angles, and overall rhythm.
Most people default to one or the other. You’re describing what happens when you stay too long in spotlight mode: each individual part is lovingly rendered, but the whole doesn’t cohere. The proportions are off not because you don’t know proportions, but because you’re not continuously cross-checking them.
Great draughtsmen are constantly “zooming” mentally:

Wide: place the landmark shapes, lightly block in the envelope of the subject.
Narrow: dive in to refine a feature.
Wide again: pull back to check how the refinement sits in the whole.
Repeat.
It’s not unlike how a composer might alternate between listening to the whole symphony and replaying a tricky 4-bar phrase — never losing track of how the phrase fits in the arc.
One way to train this “mode switching” is to force time limits on detailed work in the early stage.
For example:

Spend 2 minutes drawing the overall head shape and key placement of features (no details).
Then and only then allow yourself 5 minutes to develop the eye.
Then zoom out again and compare — adjust the head or other features if needed before you go further.
It teaches you to anchor every detail to a bigger structure — and over time, you start doing those zoom-outs unconsciously.
If you like, I can give you a short daily exercise routine designed purely to strengthen that big-picture ↔ detail switching muscle, so proportion errors drop off naturally.
```
- in this interaction ChatGPT did enhance my thinking
- I did need to clarify or correct when the LLM was saying all drawings are valid.
- Your expertise came in when I talked about my ideas of drawing.

###  [Generative AI fundamentals](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-framework-foundations/291879)

- What actually is generative AI
  - ai systems that can create new content, rather than just analysing existing data.
- large: billions of params, like brain synapses
- Came from:
  - new algos and architecture: 2017 transformer architecture
  - Explosion of data online for training
  - Computational power
    - GPUs (graphics procesing units)
    - TPUs
  - The scaling laws:
    - as models grow their capabilities grow in tande,
    - but also surprising new capabilities arise
- Initial/Pre-training
  - the model builds a complex map of language learning the patterns that make language meaningful.
-Fine tuning:
  - after pre-training:
  - follow instructions
  - provide helpful responses
  - avoid harmful content
    - rewards and penalties
- AI context window: the limitation to how much the llm can consider at the same time.
  - it's growing, but it is a limitation

###  [Capabilities & limitations](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-framework-foundations/291880)

- writing emails that capture your voice
- They can switch between tasks effortlessly. All through converstation
- They can remember the threads of conversations later.
- Many can reach beyond their own knowledge.
- Limitations:
  - bounded by their data -> when they were trained
  - They can learn and produce errors
  - Hallucinations: they state falsehoods with confidence.
  - Context-window: there's a maximum to how much it can consider. It's a FIFO basis.
  - non-deterministic: the same question will return diffferent answers
- Humans provide:
  - critical-thinking
  - judgement
  - creativity
  - ethical oversight
- AI provides
  - speed
  - scale
  - pattern recognition
  - processing abilities
- stay abreast of these changes.
### [Delegation](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-framework-foundations/291883)

- What work is to be done? What work you should do? What work AI should do?
- What you're trying to accomplish and what you and AI can do.
- The cornerstone of good delegation isn't AI, but rather your own expertise.
- What kind of work and thinking is necessary to get me to where I need to be.
- problem awareness. The ability to understand your goals before bringing AI into it.
- 3 steps:
  - Problem Awareness: Understanding your goals and the work involved to achieve it
  - Platform Awareness: Knowing what different AI systems can do
  - Task Delegation: Strategically dividing work between you and AI
- t's not about handing over the wheel and calling it a day.

#### Exercise:

1.
- "Hi ChatGPT I would like to plan a painting and want to discuss with you what a delegation plan may look like for figuring out which parts I should delegate to an AI like you vs. not. Can you help me with this?"
- "let's start with the overall vision"
- "The why is an intriguing point, I think fundamentally I don;t know why I do anything, so painting is as good a thing to do as anything else. Also I would say that I like the admiration I get from good art work. And It's a good way to meet people. But can that qualify as a vision? I don't know I have any vision in any area of my life. maybe that's why I'm floundering in life"
2.
- I would like to research how I am related to assassinated British Prime minister Spencer Perceval, who I am related to through my grandmother, nee Sarah Perceval

###  A closer look at Delegation
- Description:
  - don't just craft prompts
  - build a bridge between your intentions and the AI's capabilities
  - AI can't read your mind, you need to explain every relevant detail:
    - output format
    - context
    - what tasks AI should do
  - be explicit
  - "product description"
  - "how" can be more important than "what"
  - Take time to explain the elements ("process description)
  - It's not a vending machine, it's an interactive system.
  - "performance description (the ability to guide the AI's approach)

- task:

"here is a bad promt -> you improve it:
"write me a story that will be exciting and short"

```
Alright — here’s a tightened, more actionable version of your prompt:
“Write a fast-paced, 300-word short story in the style of a modern thriller. Set in a bustling night market in Bangkok, the plot should unfold in real time over 10 minutes, with a clear twist ending. Focus on sensory details, tight dialogue, and building tension from the very first line.”
```
### Deep Dive 2: Effective prompting techniques

- crafting effective prompts:
  - what we want
  - how we want it done
  - how we want to interact during the task
- prompt engineering: how to craft effective AI instructions.
- provde context:
  - what do you want (be specific)
  - why do you want it
  - Who you are
- FewShot / Nshot prompting.
- 'before answering please think through this problem carefully' -> although modern systems do this by default.
  
Effective prompting combines clear communication principles with AI-specific techniques
Six foundational prompting techniques:
Give context: Be specific about what you want, why you want it, and relevant background
Show examples: Demonstrate the output style or format you're looking for
Specify constraints: Clearly define format, length, and other output requirements
Break complex tasks into steps: Guide the AI through multi-step reasoning
Ask the AI to think first: Give space for the AI to work through its process
Define the AI's role or tone: Specify how you want the AI to communicate
The "secret weapon": Ask the AI itself to help improve your prompt
Successful prompting is iterative (and perhaps also collaborative with the AI!). Expect to refine your approach based on results
Common successful patterns include providing clear task overviews, format specifications, explicit constraints, and relevant background information

- maintain a spirit of experimentation and adapt your approach based on your results.
