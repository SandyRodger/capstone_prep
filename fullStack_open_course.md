These topics by themselves aren't that complicated to learn but it's a relatively new approach to building DOM-based UIs and it takes a bit of practice to get used to. You don't need to learn these concepts to mastery, but you should gain an understand of how they work.

Important articles to read after you finish the course:

- Context Api
- useReducer Hook
- useCallback Hook
- useEffect Hook
