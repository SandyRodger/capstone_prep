Hi Chadia,

I have a rather specific situation. I am going to be doing a quite stressful online course from miid-August until December. It's a software-engineer course. The course is entirely online and  will be run on Californian time (8 hours behind us). It  culminates in a job-hunt that's supposed to set me up with a brilliant career. 

During the course I'll be under huge pressure. The course is paid for on an income sharing agreement and if I drop out I have signed a contract which means I would still owe thousands of dollars. Handling time differences is another challenge. I am a morning person, and waking late severely hinders my mental powers and my mood. And I have a whole host of hang-ups about studying and feeling stupid and incapable which are destabilising me. 

So there's a lot of pressure. And quite apart from the situation I described above I need therapy for many other reasons. But the pressing matter is this course. It's a pivotal moment in my life and I need an ally so I don't have a nervous break-down.

About me: I am a 35 year old man, coming from a teaching background. I'm single and live in a house-share in the Laines. I've tried therapy twice before in Brighton for something like 4 and 2 months, it didn't really go anywhere.

I think because the course is all online it would be better to meet face to face. I don't drive - I'm a cyclist. Are you within cycling distance of the Laines?

Thanks for your time,

Alex Rodger
